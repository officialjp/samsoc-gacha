## ‚ú® Features

This simulator is designed to capture the excitement of a real gacha game with a few unique twists!

* **Dual-Wishing System**: Why wish for one item when you can wish for two? Our unique system allows you to pull **two items simultaneously** with every wish, doubling the excitement and your chances of getting rare loot!

* **Engaging Wish Animation**: Experience the thrill of the pull! A **custom animation** plays every time you make a wish, building anticipation before the big reveal.

* **Grand Reveal**: After the animation concludes, the **items you've received are displayed clearly** on the screen, allowing you to savour your new collection.
